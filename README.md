# Energy Demand Forecast NL

Forecasting electricity demand in the Netherlands using Python, SQL and ML
Using data from ENTSO-E regarding hourly electricity demand from 2020 until 2024, I create a forecasting model for future electricity demand. *

## Contents:
- Data cleaning and merging using SQL
- Further data manipulation using Python
- Data visualistions in Python
- Building a forecasting model using Facebook Prophet in Python
- Evaluating model performance
- visualising model performance

*Due to discrepancies in formats in usage data, the years 2021 and 2022 are unsuable for me thusfar. This means the model only contains data from 2020, 2023 and 2024. This limits the forecasting abilities of the model. I am still working on finding a proper way to format the 2021 and 2022 in the right ways to make it usable and improve the forecasting model
